# 🚀 Smart Contract Auditing Roadmap

- 📌 **Note:** Roadmap 1 is designed to work best for average to above-average learners.
- ⚡ Alternate Roadmap-2 provided if you're a sharp and fast learner.
- 🎯 Choose only one out of these two.

### 🎯 _Goal: Become a Smart Contract Auditor / Smart Contract Security Researcher – starting with Solidity + Yul, then progressing to Rust, Cairo, etc. If you are confused about any resource/term mentioned below just google it_

> ⚠️ **Note:** Motivation will fluctuate. Don’t stop midway — **finish what you start**.  
> 🌍 **Non-Hindi Speakers:** Skip the Hindi courses(CodeEater-C-C++). For C++, choose an English course. All core courses are in English.

---

## ✅ Pre-requisites 📚

- 📐 Basic understanding of mathematics (up to 10th grade)
- ✍️ Ability to read, write, and understand basic English

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Don’t just watch videos — **practice actively**. Code everything yourself, explore more than what’s taught, and learn by doing.

---

## 🧩 Application Strategy

- 📝 For notes Use comments in Code Files/.md files to write concepts you learned. If you think you might need them in future.
- 🔁 **After completing Courses 6, 7, and 8**, whenever you feel stuck, revisit the code you wrote for these courses. Or 🔍 **search on Google**.

- 📘 **This instructor is fast** and provides GitHub README in course — so 📂 **search topic-wise from the README** with course completing, learn about them for 🕒 **20–30 minutes**, and 🔖 **bookmark them for future reference**. Use them whenever needed.

- 📬 **He keeps updating the course** and sends ✉️ **email notifications**. You may check those if you feel it's necessary to learn the updates.

- 🧭 **During the audit cycle** (given at the bottom), you’ll naturally figure out what’s ✅ needed and ❌ what’s not.

- 🎯 **Our goal is to help you reach there first** — in the group of smart contract auditors.

---

## ⏳ Time Estimate in Part 2

- 🕒 **~250 hrs** → \~2 months with consistency
- ⏳ **Note:** This is just an estimate. If you learn quickly, you may finish this earlier — or you can take more time to understand crucial concepts.
- ⚠️ However, we advise you to stick to the average time here and move forward to the audit.
- 🎯 Just focus on understanding the core concepts at this stage.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- 🧠 You’re a **researcher** – enjoy the process and dig deeper whenever needed.  
  🔁 The importance of many things will become clear during audits, so feel free to revisit this content or 🔍 search on Google when needed.

- 🌐 Use **Google**, 💬 **ChatGPT**, and 📄 **official docs** for errors, confusion, or curiosity.

- 🛠️ Add new useful topics to your roadmap ✅ and ❌ skip the ones that aren't relevant.

---

## ⚠️ Who Should Follow This Roadmap

- ✅ Good for average learners: complete structure, deep dive
- 🚀 Fast learners: Feel free to skip or speed up sections (**_Alternate fast-track roadmap_** available at bottom)

---

## 🔁 Optional Add-ons

### Full Stack Foundry (Updraft)

- 📚 [Crash Course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/full-stack-web3-development-crash-course)
- Do **after you start auditing** by putting this in learning bucket.

### Hardhat Path (If Needed)

> ⚠️ **[_OPTIONAL_] For the Hardhat path to dive deeper:**

- 📚 You can follow this YouTube course by Patrick Collins— [Lesson 5 to 17 (except Lesson 15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ).

- 🧪 Do this **only if** you start auditing and feel the need to learn Hardhat specifically.
- 🛠️ Alternatively, after learning the basics, you can **skip the course** and just **learn by doing** using the official **Hardhat Docs**.
- 📚 Most concepts are the same as in the Foundry course — the main difference is that **Hardhat uses JavaScript tests and Solidity for contracts**, while **Foundry uses Solidity For Both.**

- 💡 While Foundry is more commonly used in Solidity projects, many developers also use Hardhat for its additional benefits.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Part 4: Start Auditing Practice (Most Important Step)
<details>

### 🛠️ Audit Workflow (Covered in Updraft Security Course)

1. 🔄 Clone Code from GitHub or platforms like Cantina, CodeArena, CodeHawks
2. 👓 Understand deeply with focus— avoid distractions, find unique bugs
3. 📝 Write & submit report
4. 📊 Compare your report with official/community ones
5. 📚 Learn from missed bugs and Other's reports
6. 🔁 Repeat → **Cycle: Audit → Read Report → Repeat**

---

### 📆 Time Allocation (Min. 150 Hrs/month):

1. 🧠 **55%** – Auditing & research with it.
2. 📄 **20%** – Reading & analyzing reports
3. 🧪 **25%** – Continuous learning bucket (new techs, trial-error, protocol deep dives)

4. 🧘 In your free time, always try to explore new technologies and ideas in this space. 🎧 Listen to podcasts by experienced auditors, 📬 read newsletters, and 👀 observe how others approach things — if you find something important, add it to your learning bucket.
   💡 Dive into DeFi concepts and protocols. 📖 Explore the codebases of leading projects like Uniswap, OpenZeppelin, Aave, and Chainlink to deepen your understanding. Add them to your learning bucket to read their code. Or whenever needed during a audit. Make new plans to proceed further and update your roadmap if needed.

> 🔁 Keep exploring consistently — this adds long-term depth to your skills.

---

### 🚀 After Another 400–500 Hrs of Auditing (Step 1-3)

- 🎯 Ideally, you'll begin earning within this phase. **Have patience of auditing 400 Hrs. without expecting earning.**
- 🕰️ \~1400–1500 total hours (\~8–9 months) Yet.
- This is never ending part.

> ✅ If you’ve made it this far, welcome—you’ve arrived. Now go deeper, strengthen your understanding, and **secure your space**.

## 🚀 Smart Contract Auditing Roadmap – Fast Path for High-IQ Learners

<details>
<summary>Roadmap 2 -Fast Paced</summary>


> 🧠 _Designed for self-learners, fast movers, and those who prefer learning by doing._

If you're a sharp, fast learner, you might not need a slow-paced course or endless tutorials. Some smart folks jump straight into **Patrick Collins’ Updraft course** and begin auditing directly. Others read articles, explore codebases, and build hands-on without watching much video content.

Whatever your style, this roadmap outlines a **fast and efficient path (~550 hours)** to start auditing **real protocols** in just **3–4 months**.

> ⚠️ Customize this path to fit your skills and learning style. Use other great roadmaps like [C Michel's](https://cmichel.io/how-to-become-a-smart-contract-auditor/) to fill any gaps.
