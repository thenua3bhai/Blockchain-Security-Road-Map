# 🚀 Smart Contract Auditing Roadmap

- 📌 **Note:** This roadmap is designed to work best for average to above-average learners.
- ⚡ If you're a sharp and fast learner, there’s an alternate roadmap provided below for you to follow.

### 🎯 _Goal: Become a Smart Contract Auditor / Smart Contract Security Researcher – starting with Solidity + Yul, then progressing to Rust, Cairo, etc. If you are confused about any resource/term mentioned below just google it_

> ⚠️ **Note:** Motivation will fluctuate. Don’t stop midway — **finish what you start**.  
> 🌍 **Non-Hindi Speakers:** Skip the Hindi courses(CodeEater-C-C++). For C++, choose an English course. All core courses are in English.

---

## ✅ Pre-requisites 📚

- 📐 Basic understanding of mathematics (up to 10th grade)
- ✍️ Ability to read, write, and understand basic English

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Don’t just watch videos — **practice actively**. Code everything yourself, explore more than what’s taught, and learn by doing.

## 🧩 Application Strategy

- 📝 For notes Use comments in Code Files/.md files to write concepts you learned. If you think you might need them in future.
- 🔁 **After completing Courses 6, 7, and 8**, whenever you feel stuck, revisit the code you wrote for these courses. Or 🔍 **search on Google**.

- 📘 **This instructor is fast** and provides GitHub README in course — so 📂 **search topic-wise from the README** with course completing, learn about them for 🕒 **20–30 minutes**, and 🔖 **bookmark them for future reference**. Use them whenever needed.

- 📬 **He keeps updating the course** and sends ✉️ **email notifications**. You may check those if you feel it's necessary to learn the updates.

- 🧭 **During the audit cycle** (given at the bottom), you’ll naturally figure out what’s ✅ needed and ❌ what’s not.

- 🎯 **Our goal is to help you reach there first** — in the group of smart contract auditors.

---

## ⏳ Time Estimate in Part 2

- 🕒 **~250 hrs** → \~2 months with consistency
- ⏳ **Note:** This is just an estimate. If you learn quickly, you may finish this earlier — or you can take more time to understand crucial concepts.
- ⚠️ However, we advise you to stick to the average time here and move forward to the audit.
- 🎯 Just focus on understanding the core concepts at this stage.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- 🧠 You’re a **researcher** – enjoy the process and dig deeper whenever needed.  
  🔁 The importance of many things will become clear during audits, so feel free to revisit this content or 🔍 search on Google when needed.

- 🌐 Use **Google**, 💬 **ChatGPT**, and 📄 **official docs** for errors, confusion, or curiosity.

- 🛠️ Add new useful topics to your roadmap ✅ and ❌ skip the ones that aren't relevant.

---

## ⚠️ Who Should Follow This Roadmap

- ✅ Good for average learners: complete structure, deep dive
- 🚀 Fast learners: Feel free to skip or speed up sections (**_Alternate fast-track roadmap_** available at bottom)

---

## 🔁 Optional Add-ons

### Full Stack Foundry (Updraft)

- 📚 [Crash Course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/full-stack-web3-development-crash-course)
- Do **after you start auditing** by putting this in learning bucket.

### Hardhat Path (If Needed)

> ⚠️ **[_OPTIONAL_] For the Hardhat path to dive deeper:**

- 📚 You can follow this YouTube course by Patrick Collins— [Lesson 5 to 17 (except Lesson 15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ).

- 🧪 Do this **only if** you start auditing and feel the need to learn Hardhat specifically.
- 🛠️ Alternatively, after learning the basics, you can **skip the course** and just **learn by doing** using the official **Hardhat Docs**.
- 📚 Most concepts are the same as in the Foundry course — the main difference is that **Hardhat uses JavaScript tests and Solidity for contracts**, while **Foundry uses Solidity For Both.**

- 💡 While Foundry is more commonly used in Solidity projects, many developers also use Hardhat for its additional benefits.
